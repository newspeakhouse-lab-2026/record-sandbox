# Monthly review agenda

The Convener convenes a retrospective each month. This compiles what belongs on it.

It is **compilation, not judgement.** You list what exists and what its own text says about itself. You do not report whether anything has passed, and you do not pronounce anything ready to merge — see the hard rules in `AGENTS.md`. Deliberation happens in a channel you cannot read.

Start by establishing today's date with `date`. Several items below are relative to it.

## 1. Experiments expiring before the next review

The ones that matter most, because **they expire automatically** unless adopted or extended by the procedure for their own layer. An expiry nobody noticed is a rule that silently stopped existing.

```bash
ls policies/*/exp-* rules/exp-* 2>/dev/null
grep -rl "expires\|End date\|Ends\|success criteria" policies/ rules/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each: its end date, its stated hypothesis and success criteria, and what its own text says operates when it expires. Quote the criteria rather than assessing whether they were met — that is the cohort's call at the review.

## 2. Instruments approaching an end date

Including the Constitution itself. Read its expiry and the re-ratification deadline out of §5 — never from memory — and read the interim terms out of `roles.md`. Then count the days and say so plainly.

Interim arrangements, time-limited rules and recurring bookings that lapse unless reaffirmed belong here too.

## 3. Open proposals, and what blocks each

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt,reviews
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt
git branch -a
```

For each: its layer, who proposed it, when it opened, and **what is blocking it** — missing endorsements, an unanswered objection, no text yet, or a clock that never started because nobody posted it to the governance channel.

Report blockers, not verdicts. "Opened eleven days ago, no endorsing reviews, so the Layer 4 clock has not started" is useful and true. "Ready to merge" is neither.

## 4. Stale proposals

Open with no movement for weeks — especially any whose clock never started for want of endorsements. These are the ones that quietly die, and the review is where they get picked up or withdrawn deliberately.

## 5. Rules that should migrate

Standalone rules in `rules/` that now belong inside a policy folder, because a policy for that area has since been adopted. See the `classify` skill.

```bash
ls rules/ ; ls policies/
```

## 6. Adopted since the last review

What merged, with links. Short, but it is the only place the cohort sees its own output.

The standing format is what went well, what could be improved, and action items — and that format is itself changeable at these sessions. Hand the Convener a draft they can edit, not a finished agenda.
