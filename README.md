# Constitutional Record — Newspeak House Governance Laboratory 2026

The authoritative record of every rule, policy and constitutional decision of the 2026 Newspeak House Governance Laboratory, a fourteen-member research programme operating under a Charter devolved from the London College of Political Technology.

**A rule is valid only if it was adopted through the procedure required for its layer, its exact adopted text appears here, and it has not expired, been repealed or been superseded.** A repository edit or commit does not itself create authority.

The Laboratory acts as a body only through its registered Agent. Anything else is a communication from its individual sender.

## Layers

The layer is determined by a decision's actual effect, not by the label its proposer chooses. Where two layers are reasonably arguable, the more demanding process applies.

| Layer | What | Where | How it is adopted |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4** Constitutional | Rights, thresholds, procedures, allocation of authority | `constitution.md` | 2 endorsing reviews, 7 days, two-thirds of all members |
| **3** Policy | Governance systems for an area — mechanisms, offices, ongoing financial flows | `policies/{area}/policy.md` | 1 endorsement, preference mapping, 7 days, majority of all members |
| **2** Ordinary | Rules and parameters within an existing frame | `policies/{area}/rule-*.md` or `rules/rule-*.md` | Tier A 48h, Tier B under 7 days, or Tier C 7+ days with a vote |
| **1** Coordination | Scheduling, logistics | Governance channel | Post it; no commit |
| **0** Operational | Reversible action within existing rules | — | Just do it; no commit |

A time-limited experiment takes the `exp-` prefix at whatever layer it belongs to, states a hypothesis, success criteria and an end date, and expires automatically unless adopted or extended. Adjudication decisions live in `disputes/dispute-*.md`. §1's file list calls them precedent and §4 says they bind only the parties and create no general rules; **the Constitution contradicts itself here**, and §4 is the operative provision on effect.

## What is here

| | |
|---|---|
| `constitution.md` | The Constitution. The authority. |
| `members.md` | Authoritative membership. Every threshold is a fraction of this. |
| `roles.md` | Current role holders and when their terms end, maintained by the Record Keepers. |
| `rules/` | Standalone Ordinary Rules. |
| `policies/` | One folder per governed area. **None yet** — the first Policy resolution creates one. |
| `disputes/` | Adjudication decisions. **None yet.** |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | **How to propose, deliberate and record a decision.** Start here. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Instructions for members' AI agents working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line pointer to it, so tools looking for either name find the same file. |
| `docs/` | The [dashboard](https://newspeakhouse-lab-2026.github.io/constitutional-record/) — deadlines, open proposals, what is in force, and how the Record changed. |

## Proposing something

Put the text on a branch and open a pull request — that is the proposal of record, and its template asks for everything the Constitution requires, including the reasoning behind your layer classification. If you want to propose something before drafting the text, open an issue with the Proposal form first. Full walkthrough in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — no command line needed.

Deliberation happens here, in the governance channel, and in meetings. Voting happens as the Constitution specifies for the layer; **GitHub is not the voting platform.** A Record Keeper merges once the process has been verified, which is a clerical act and not a second vote.

If GitHub is a barrier for you, it must not cost you a right: the Convener provides a reasonably equivalent route, and anything submitted that way is recorded as the Constitution otherwise requires.

## Current state

- **`members.md` is the roll**, and every threshold is a fraction of it, so none is written down as a number here. `.github/scripts/tally.py` computes one and shows its working. Two rules: a named fraction rounds up, and a majority is *more than half* — so a tie fails.
- **Interim role holders** — Agent, Convener, Treasurer and Record Keeper — were elected after the Constitutional Convention under Constitution §6 and are recorded in `roles.md`. Ordinary elections follow Constitution §3.2, which #2 rewrote: each office, including each deputy, is filled by its own anonymous ranked-choice ballot for a two-month term.
- **Those interim terms were extended to 23:59 UK time on Monday 2 November 2026** by pull request #2, adopted under §6 on 4 October, or until holders are elected under §3.2, whichever is earlier. All four offices still end at the same moment, so §3's fallback — the Convener covering unfilled roles — will not cover the next expiry either.
- **§6's expedited amendment window was not extended** and closed at 23:59 on 4 October. An amendment is once again Layer 4: two endorsing reviews, seven days, and two-thirds of all members.
- **This Constitution expires at 23:59 UK time on Monday 30 November 2026** unless re-ratified or replaced by two-thirds of all members. A re-ratification or replacement proposal must have obtained its endorsements and entered its seven-day deliberation period **no later than Monday 23 November 2026.** If it lapses, functions revert to the College.

## Notes on this repository

The repository is **public**. Anything committed here — files, commit messages, pull request comments — is visible to anyone and stays in the history. Candid or sensitive discussion belongs in the governance channel. Never commit personal data.

The authoritative history may not be rewritten to erase an adopted decision; errors are corrected by a new commit and superseded material is archived rather than deleted. Material may be removed where retaining it would disclose personal or confidential information or create a serious risk of harm, with the removal and its reason recorded.

**Branch protection is configured**, and `.github/ruleset-main.json` records it: every change to `main` arrives as a pull request, the branch cannot be deleted or force-pushed, and only organisation administrators — currently the two Record Keepers — can merge, as Constitution §3 requires.

Two gaps remain, and both are human rather than technical. §1 describes protection that "enforces approval requirements per path"; nothing does that, because GitHub cannot vary a required review count by file. And no approving review is required at all, deliberately — a Layer 2 proposal needs no endorsement, so demanding one would have forced a procedural click. **So nothing technically prevents a Layer 4 amendment merging without its two endorsing reviews**; the Record Keeper verifying the process is what prevents it. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
