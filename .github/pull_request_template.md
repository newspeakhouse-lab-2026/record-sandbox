<!--
Only a merged pull request adopts anything, so this template carries everything
the Constitution requires — a pull request opened without a prior issue is
complete on its own.

Layer, Tier and Deliberation period are read automatically and turned into
labels the dashboard uses. Write bare values — "2", "A", "5". Fill this in
rather than replacing it: comments in <!-- --> never appear in the posted body.
-->

## Proposal

**Layer:** <!-- write just the number: 2, 3, 4 — or 0 for a correction creating no rule -->

<!-- 2 Ordinary · 3 Policy · 4 Constitutional. Classified by actual EFFECT, not by
convenience. Where two layers are arguable, the more demanding process applies. -->

**Tier:** <!-- Layer 2 only. Write just the letter: A, B or C -->

<!-- A — 48h, passes absent a stated objection
     B — a stated period under 7 days, passes absent a stated objection
     C — 7 days or more, simple majority of those voting, quorum of half of all members
A proposal may enter at any tier. One stated objection moves it up a tier; it
never moves down. -->

**Deliberation period:** <!-- Tier B only. Write just the number of days, under 7 -->

<!-- Constitution §2 requires a Tier B proposal to run for "a stated period of less than seven
days". A period that was never stated cannot have elapsed. -->

**File(s):**
<!-- policies/{area}/policy.md · policies/{area}/rule-*.md · rules/rule-*.md ·
constitution.md · exp- prefix for a time-limited experiment -->

**Resolves:**
<!-- #N if there is an issue, otherwise "no prior issue" -->

### What this does

<!-- Plain sentences. What changes for members. -->

### Why this layer

<!-- REQUIRED (Constitution §2). Not the label — the reasoning. Name the effect
that determines the layer, say why the layer above is not required, and why the
layer below is insufficient if anyone might argue for it. -->

### `Observed by:`

<!-- REQUIRED if this creates any enforceable duty. How would fulfilment or
breach reasonably become known, in the ordinary course? This authorises no new
surveillance and no collection that would not otherwise reasonably become
available. If it creates no duty, write: none — creates no enforceable duty. -->

### Conflicts checked

<!-- What you searched and what you found. Name anything this supersedes.
  grep -ri "{keyword}" constitution.md policies/ rules/
  gh pr list --state open ; gh issue list --state open ; git branch -a
  gh repo list newspeakhouse-lab-2026     # private repos run live systems
Write "none found" only after saying what you searched. -->

### Source of authority — Layer 3 and 4

<!-- What in the Charter or Constitution gives the Laboratory power here.
Name anything adjacent that Charter §8 reserves to the College: the Hall's
programme, the Access Register, the building's fabric, the College's legal,
financial and safety obligations, Fellowship admission, Faculty appointment,
the Dean's office. -->

### Does this expire?

<!-- If the instrument has an end date, declare it in one line the dashboard can read,
inside the instrument itself:

  **Ends:** 23:59 UK time, Monday 30 November 2026 (`2026-11-30T23:59:00+00:00`) — reason

Write the UTC offset explicitly: the UK is on BST from late March to late October,
so 23:59 on 4 October is +01:00 and on 30 November is +00:00. -->

### Experiment

- [ ] **This is a time-limited experiment** — filed with an `exp-` prefix

<!-- Any proposal at any layer may be an experiment. The prefix changes the
expiry, not the threshold or the process. Complete the four below only if the
box is ticked; delete them otherwise. -->

- **Hypothesis:** <!-- stated so it could turn out false -->
- **Success criteria:** <!-- and which one is decisive if they disagree -->
- **End date:** <!-- leave a monthly review before it, so the cohort extends deliberately -->
- **What operates on expiry:** <!-- REQUIRED. An experiment whose expiry breaks the instrument containing it is not an experiment, it is a dependency. -->

### Endorsements

<!-- Layer 3: one other member. Layer 4: two endorsing reviews, which start the
7-day clock. Layer 2: none required. -->

## Checks

<!-- Only the things the sections above do not already ask for. -->

- [ ] Filed at the path the layer requires, `exp-` prefixed if time-limited
- [ ] Thresholds computed from the current `members.md`, fractions rounded **up**
- [ ] Dates and arithmetic computed, not recalled — including the weekday where the text names one
- [ ] Cross-references resolve — every section cited exists
- [ ] No personal data — no contact details, nothing identifying guests or non-members
- [ ] Reasoning in a companion `rationale.md`, not in the operative text; provisional numbers marked provisional
- [ ] **Does this create, change or remove a deadline?** If so, update `docs/data.json` here. Nothing can detect a deadline newly added to the Constitution — only this question can

## Amendment record — complete before merge

<!-- Constitution §1 requires six things to be recorded for an amendment to the
Constitution or to a rule. The date and time is the commit timestamp, so five are
left for you. Write what actually happened, not what was proposed. -->

- **How it was made:**
  <!-- §1 wants a "brief narrative description of how the amendment was made
  (e.g. by consent, by consensus, by majority / supermajority vote)" — those
  examples are the Constitution's own. One sentence. For a Tier A rule nobody
  objected to: "Lazy consensus — posted to the governance channel on 4 October,
  no objection within 48 hours." Where there was a vote, put the numbers here. -->

- **Assumptions it rests on:**
  <!-- What has to stay true for this to keep making sense: a price, a headcount,
  somebody holding a role, a platform still existing. This is what tells a later
  reader whether the rule still fits the world it was written for. -->

- **Status:**
  <!-- live, experimental, or archived — §1's own three words. -->

- **Explanatory notes from the discussion:**
  <!-- What was argued, and what changed because of it. Anything a reader would
  otherwise have to reconstruct from scattered comments. -->

- **Abstentions or objections:**
  <!-- §1: recorded "in aggregate where the applicable procedure uses an anonymous
  or secret ballot". Name nobody who did not object openly. -->

## Process — for the merging Record Keeper

- [ ] Deliberation period elapsed, **verified in the governance channel as well as here** — absence of objection on this pull request is not by itself proof of lazy consensus
- [ ] Endorsements obtained where the layer requires them
- [ ] Recorded outcome matches what actually happened
- [ ] Merged by a Record Keeper — Constitution §3: *"either may merge"*, the author included

<!-- If an AI agent helped prepare this, say so and name the member responsible.
Constitution §1 requires agents on Laboratory infrastructure to be clearly
identifiable as the agent of a specific member. -->
